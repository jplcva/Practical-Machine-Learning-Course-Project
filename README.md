Repository for Course Project for Practical Machine Learning on Coursera

This is the course project for the Practical Machine Learning class. The goal of the project is to perform prediction on a data set representing metrics associated to a weigh lifting exercise. The data has been collected during the [Human Activity Recognition](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.) project, from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants, who were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The data set contains the `classe` colunm, representing the outcome to predict. `classe` is a factor variable with 5 levels "A", "B", "C", "D" and "E".

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).
